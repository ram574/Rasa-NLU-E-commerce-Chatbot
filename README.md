## Business Objective

 

In simple terms, a chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversation, either written or spoken, allowing humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a real person.

Chatbots can be as simple as a program that can answer a simple query with a single-line response or as sophisticated as digital assistants that learn and evolve to deliver increasing levels of personalization as they gather and process information.

 

There are two main types of chatbots:

 

## Rule-based chatbots 
In a rule-based type of bot, communication is through a pre-defined rule. User input must conform to these pre-set rules to get an answer. Example: A chatbot that answers basic customer inquiries like the status of oneâ€™s delivery, returns request process, tracking information, etc. 

 

## AI-based chatbots
AI chatbots make use of machine learning to understand the context and intent of a question before formulating a response. These chatbots generate their own answers to more complicated questions using natural-language responses. The more you use and train these bots, the more they learn and the better they operate with the user.

 

The working of an AI-driven chatbot depends on two main concepts, the intent and the entity. 

Intent - Intention or purpose of the user in the conversational flow.
Entity - A data point or value which you can extract from a conversation
 

In our case study, we will use the Rasa NLU model to build the chatbot.

Rasa is an open-source machine learning framework for automated text and voice-based conversations. Understand messages, hold conversations, and connect to messaging channels and APIs.

 

We will build an AI-based chatbot using an E-Commerce business case.

## Data Description 

 

The data can be curated from the following two data curation websites,

* Rasa NLU trainer: 
* https://rasahq.github.io/rasa-nlu-trainer/
* Chatito: 
* https://rodrigopivi.github.io/Chatito/
* The business case we will be considering is E-Commerce,
* The intents consist of product_info, ask_price, cancel_order
* The entities consist of product, location and order_id
 

 

## Aim

 

To build an AI chatbot using the Rasa NLU model.

 

 

## Tech stack

 

## Language - Python

Libraries â€“ pandas, matplotlib, rasa, pymongo, tensorflow, spacy

 

 

## Approach

 

* Perform data curation to obtain the data
* Importing the required packages and libraries
* Import the data
* Create a function to convert the data into training and testing dataframes
* Convert the dataframes to JSON files
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
* Data Visualization
* Create configuration files (.yaml) for spacy and TensorFlow.
* Model Building
* Define a function to train the Rasa NLU model.
* Model Evaluation
* Define a function to perform a model evaluation on test data
* Train the data using spacy as the pipeline
* Train the data using TensorFlow as the pipeline
* Plot confusion matrix for both the models
* Interpreting the model
* Install MongoDB and import pymongo
* Create an IntentFlow class
* Create a ContextManager class
* Create a function for processing a message.
* Test the chatbot
